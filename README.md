moving ball:

Description:

This HTML page displays a continuous bouncing green ball in tha area of desktop, controlled by JavaScript using the setInterval function with a 100
-millisecond interval.

How to run the code:

Step 1: Save the HTML file with a .html extension.

Step 2: Install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code, then click the "Go Live" button at the bottom right corner of the VSCode window to open a new browser window displaying the ball-moving animation.

Future improvement:

Consider adding user interaction features like mouse or keyboard control to change the ball's direction or speed, or adding obstacles or targets for the ball to interact with, creating a more engaging and interactive animation.
